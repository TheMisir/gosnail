Experimental express.js like HTTP router written in golang. This project was
just a demostration to check whether or not we could create "developer friendly"
API for http routing.

## Why?

Because current state of routing libraries in golang is not much friendly for
newcomer developers to golang coming from much simplier environments like
node.js. Bla blah... To be honest, I was just bored and tried to do something
for fun.

**It's not likely that I'm going to continue to work on this repository. So
please don't use it.**

Also if you read this far, I wanna let you know that I hate golang's module /
package management system. That's it, thanks for coming to my TED talk.
